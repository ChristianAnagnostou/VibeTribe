# Jamming App

Jamming app availible at [christians-jams.surge.sh](http://christians-jams.surge.sh/) built in React.

## Building Process

1. Created a new React project (npx create-react-app).

2. Decided to practice with React class components for this project. Also didn't want to include any packages to assist with the project so that I could get a handle for everything myself.

3. The first approach was to create searching functionality and to connect that search to Spotify's API.

4. Displaying the requested search results and enabling them to be added to a new playlist was the next task.

5. Following the creation of the search results, I wanted to include a way to sample a snippet of the song, so that the user could have more information in making their decision to include the song in their playlist.

6. The snippets were playing over eachother if the user clicked multiple play buttons one after another, so I had to implement a way to control having only one snippet play at a time. This ended up being the most challending part of the project.

7. Next, the objective was to give the user the ability to save their playlist to their spotify account.

8. At this point, the app was working, but I wanted to add a way to upload an existing playlist that the user had already created. This, again, was simple through the Spotify API and was easily extended to being an account tab for the user to access their account and playlists.
